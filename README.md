# Email-sender


My app collects email addresses from an Excel file and sends emails to each of those addresses one by one using Python. Here's a brief description of how your app works:

1. Read Excel file: This app reads an Excel file that contains a list of email addresses. You can also use a library like `pandas` or `openpyxl` to parse and extract the email addresses from the file.

2. Store email addresses: After reading the Excel file, this app stores the extracted email addresses in a data structure, such as a list or an array, to keep track of them.

3. Configure email settings: This app sets up the necessary configurations for sending emails. This includes specifying the SMTP server, port, and any authentication credentials required by the email service provider you're using.

4. Create email content: Your app prepares the content of the email that will be sent to each recipient. This could include the subject, body, attachments, and any other relevant information.

5. Iterate over email addresses: Using a loop, this app iterates over each email address in the list or array created earlier.

6. Compose and send email: For each email address, this app composes an email using the configured settings and the email content. It uses a library like `smtplib` to establish a connection with the SMTP server and send the email to the recipient.

7. Handle exceptions: Throughout the process of sending emails, this app should handle any potential exceptions or errors that may occur, such as network issues or invalid email addresses. This helps ensure the reliability and robustness of your app.

8. Completion and logging: Once all the emails have been sent, this app may display a completion message or log relevant information, such as the number of successful deliveries, any failed deliveries, and any errors encountered.

It's important to note that when sending bulk emails, you should follow the appropriate email sending guidelines and policies, such as avoiding spamming, respecting privacy regulations, and ensuring that recipients have provided consent to receive emails from you. Additionally, some email service providers may have specific limitations or restrictions on the number of emails you can send in a given time period.
